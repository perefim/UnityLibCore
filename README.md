This is a personal project to try to get Unity3D builds to run on a Miyoo A30 system.
The current system uses 32bit RetroArch.

The .so file is located in the cores folder, and .info file in the core info folder.
If attempting to install it says the core is already installed.
However the core will not load when attempting to load the core.
Instead you will have no core, listed in bottom left of RetroArch screen.

When going to "Manage Cores" if you select the libunity.so core you will see no core information is available.

Disclaimer: I really don't know much I am just trying to get this working using chatGPT.
This is as far as I have gotten and can't seem to move past this point.

Thanks,

Alex
